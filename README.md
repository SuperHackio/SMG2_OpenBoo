# SMG2 OpenBoo
### Spooky Speedster in SMG2


## Compatibility Warning
For the time being, this module only supports Vanilla. It does not work with [Galaxy Level Engine](https://www.github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine). Once a Syati API Module for GLE is made, compatibility will be enabled.


This is an enhanced port of the Spooky Speedster from Super Mario Galaxy. It includes new SMG2 specific features while still being faithful to the original.

Below is a list of everything included:
- The ObjectData archives for the Spooky Speedster.
- The "TeresaRacer" object in the editor
- The "AnmModelBindMove" ProductMapObjDataTable class. (Used for the bouncy Meat Bones)

Below is a list of other things that you will need:
- A level editor

The setup for Speedster is the same in SMG1.
