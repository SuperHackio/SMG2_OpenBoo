### Spooky Speedster in SMG2


## Compatibility Notice
The [Galaxy Level Engine](https://www.github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine) API Module is required for this module if you are using GLE


This is an enhanced port of the Spooky Speedster from Super Mario Galaxy. It includes new SMG2 specific features while still being faithful to the original.

Below is a list of everything included:
- The ObjectData archives for the Spooky Speedster.
- The "TeresaRacer" object in the editor
- The "AnmModelBindMove" ProductMapObjDataTable class. (Used for the bouncy Meat Bones)

Below is a list of other things that you will need:

The setup for Speedster is the same in SMG1.
